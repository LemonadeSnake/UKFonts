# UKFonts
Collection of fonts found in British grocery stores.
Doesn't account for any minor stores, or stores from other countries such as ALDI or Lidl, only is for the big 3: ASDA, Tesco and Morrisons. Tesco and Morrisons have older versions of their fonts (Tesco and Kievit), which is why they have more.
